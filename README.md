## Project Overview

Ever found it challenging to search for recipes and ingredients while cooking? Vocal Recipe is the solution! This integrated platform provides users with comprehensive information about home-cooked meals. From recipes with nutrition details to measurement conversions, cooking tools, and more, we've got you covered. The standout feature of Vocal Recipe is its voice control capability, enabling users to access information without needing to touch anything while cooking.

## 🛠️ How We Built Vocal Recipe

- **Recipes and Nutrition Information:** We sourced data from Spoonacular, an integrated food and recipe API, to provide a vast array of recipes and their nutrition information.

- **Voice Control System:** The voice control feature was implemented using Dasha AI, an AI voice recognition system, enabling seamless conversations between users and our platform.

- **Measurement Conversion Tool:** We incorporated a simple calculator to facilitate measurement conversions, ensuring precise cooking.
